      <h2>About Grill Avenue</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025, Grill Avenue is dedicated to serving the freshest, most delicious burgers in town. Our journey began with a simple mission: to bring people together over great food made with passion and the finest ingredients.

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        What started as a small family-run burger stand has grown into a beloved local eatery. We believe that every burger should be a memorable experience, which is why we handcraft each patty, bake our buns daily, and use only locally sourced produce.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Ingredients:</strong> We use 100% fresh beef, farm-fresh vegetables, and homemade sauces.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Focused:</strong> We support local farmers and participate in community events.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Your happiness is our top priority. We welcome feedback and strive to improve every day.</li>
      </ul>
